This file includes daily gapfilled LE and H and their version where a correction for the energy balance closure has been applied, including estimates of the uncertainties in the corrected fluxes.

The corrected fluxes are obtained multiplying the original, gapfilled data by a correction factor (EBCcf: Energy Closure Balance correction factor) calculated starting from the halfhours where all the components needed to calculated the energy balance closure are available (Latent Heat, Sensible Heat, Net Radiation, Soil Heat Flux, with LE and H original or gapfilled with high quality).
The EBCcf is calculated for each day only if at least 50% of the half hours have all the four components measured. EBCcf is calculated as (NETRAD-G)/(H+LE) where NETRAD, G, H and LE are the daily averages. The EBCcf timeserie is filtered removing the values that are outside 1.5 times the interquartile range and used as basis to calculate the corrected H and LE fluxes.

The corrected fluxes calculation are obtained using three hierarchical methods:

Method 1: For each day a moving window of +/- 7 days is applied to select up to 15 EBCcf values. The selected EBCcf are then used to calculate corrected versions of the LE and H fluxes (one corrected fluxes version for each EBCcf factor included in the moving window) and 25, 50 and 75 percentiles of the corrected fluxes are extracted (LEcorr25, LEcorr, LEcorr75, Hcorr25, Hcorr,Hcorr75).

Method 2: applied in the days where the moving window of method 1 includes less than 5 EBCcf values. The corrected fluxes are calculated using the average of the EBCcf used to calculate LEcorr and Hcorr in method 1 in the days included in a moving window of +/- 5 days. With method 2 LEcorr25, Hcorr25, LEcorr75 and Hcorr75 are not calculated.

Method 3: If it is still not possible to calculate an EBCcf (e.g. in case of long gaps) the same moving window is also applied to the same day of the years before and after when available. With method 3 LEcorr25, Hcorr25, LEcorr75 and Hcorr75 are not calculated.


LE and H are always expressed as W m-2
