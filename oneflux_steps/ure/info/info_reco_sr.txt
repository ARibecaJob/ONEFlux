This file includes {TIMERES} Ecosystem Respiration (RECO) estimates obtained following the van Goersel et al. 2009 method that uses fluxes (turbulent and storage) at Sunrise to parameterize a soil temperature-RECO function. The parameterization of the model is done for each calendar year separately.
The RECO estimates are based on data not ustar filtered and, for this reason, the uncertainty due to the ustar threshold is not propagated in this product.
{RECO is expressed as umolCO2 m-2 s-1 OR RECO is expressed as gC m-2 d-1 OR RECO is expressed as gC m-2 y-1}

- RECO = Ecosystem Respiration calculated with the van Goersel et al. 2009 method
- RECO_n (solo da dd in poi) = percentage of data available in the averaging period

Failure of the model parameterization:
When not enough data are available to parameterize the model the RECO can not be calculated. In this site the partitioning model was not applied in the years:
