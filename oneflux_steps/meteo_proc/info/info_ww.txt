The file contain a set of meteorological variables gapfilled and/or downscaled from the ERA-interim dataset aggregated at weekly time resolution. The downscaling both in space (from cell to tower) and time (6 hourly to half hourly) is applied to seven variables using regressions with the site measurements when available according to the method described in Vuichard and Papale 2015.
The gapfilling of the site level measurements have been done using the MDS method as described in Reichstein et al. 2005.
For the variables where the ERA-interim downscaling has been applied, a merged version using the MDS gapfilled and the downscaled is also provided.
