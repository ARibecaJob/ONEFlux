NEE PROCESSING RESULTS DESCRIPTION

This file includes daily NEE estimate and related uncertainty and nighttime and daytime NEE averages and related uncertainties. The starting dataset is NEE already corrected by storage and de-spiked (method described in Papale et al 2006 Biogeosciences, z=5). The ustar filtering has been based on thresholds calculated using two different methods (Barr et al 2013 and modified version of Reichstein et al 2005) and for each of the two methods using 100 bootstrapped datasets (for a total of 200 ustar thresholds estimates for each year).

Two different methods have been used to extract the ustar thresholds to be applied:
- yearly (identified in the variables names ending with "_y"): the thresholds found for each year and the years before and after have been put together and from their join population the final threshold extracted (ustar thresholds varying among years).
- common (identified in the variables names ending with "_c"): all the thresholds found in the different years have been put together and final thresholds extracted from this dataset (each year filtered with the same ustar threshold).
Note that if the dataset includes up to two years of data the two methods give the same result and only the _y is provided.

In both the _y and _c versions, 40 NEE datasets have been created filtering the original NEE using 40 different ustar values extracted from the thresholds datasets at percentiles [1.25:2.5:98.75]. These 40 NEE versions have been first aggregated to daily time resolution and then used as basis for all the derived variables provided.

NEE is always expressed as gC m-2 d-1 except for the nighttime and daytime aggregations where it is in umolCO2 m-2 s-1
